Features to implement:

Michael Snoyman suggests that instead of using a static subsite,
we do something like the following:

   The only recommendation that comes to mind
   would be to put some of the hard-coded static paths used in
   makeDefaultLayout into the HasGitit typeclass, with sensible defaults.
   That would theoretically make it much easier for users to override. In
   the specific case of jQuery, you could use the existing YesodJquery
   class from yesod-form. In general, the approach we take for these kinds
   of typeclasses is to have methods like:
   siteLogo :: master -> Either Text (Route master)
   That way, the user can load the information from the master site
   datatype if desired (which in turn means it can be in a config file),
   and the `Either Text Route` lets the user either specify some external
   URL or a type-safe URL.
